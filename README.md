# Waldo Tech Test by Emma Sargeant

## Objective: To create a copy of UX predesign using Tailwind CSS and React.
---

* You can see the live app [here](https://emmasarge.github.io/waldo-tech-redo/)
* Github pages [here](https://github.com/emmasarge/waldo-tech-redo)

* Please refer to my initial attempt on ['Waldo-Tech-Test'](https://github.com/emmasarge/waldo-tech-test) to see my commits. Due to an issue with deploying and taking some bad internet advice, I restarted with a new repository to deploy as soon as I created the app. I have not experienced this before, definitely will not happen again but due to time pressure I transferred all of my code to this new repo.

## Issues
---
* I had issues with deploying my original app. I regret not deploying immediately after initialising app. I created a new app and transferred my [orginal code.](https://github.com/emmasarge/waldo-tech-test) This was not an ideal solution but you can follow my commit path which is available in the original repository. I need to become more efficient at React App Deployment but I am confident I have it now. 

* I created a carousel for the Sales Heros. I was trying to find a template from Tailwind as I normally use Bootstrap or Materialize so I tried using React to create the sliding images instead as I was using sections rather than images. I did find an alternative to the indicators, the arrows, as I needed more time to figure out how to use the eclipse circles as buttons to change the page. I was using Chrome Dev Tools to look at the Waldo site to check this out.

* The right side of the hero image is not how I would prefer it. I individually altered each image to make it as similar as possible to the previous image postion-wise. I want to make the image and ecclipse separate rows to align better. This is something I will continue to figure out whilst becoming more familiar with Tailwind. This is a layout issue. 

* General cleanup. I used Tailwind and custom css, there is some redundant styling I need to remove. Also, I need to move the Body.Css into the App.Css because I used the Body.js initially to experiment how I will create the slide image with text the best way to make a carousel effect. 


## Testing 
---
* React Jest installed in CLI identified errors and prohibited project from displaying when errors are found
* Chrome developer Tools

## Future Goals
* I would like to fix the layout of the right side of the slider image.
* I want to make my code more efficient and clean. I feel I have a little too much going on that could be cut down.
* I would like to understand creating the ecclipse buttons.
* Continue to apply React to more projects to become more fluent and get more familiar with Tailspin.
* DEPLOY IMMEDIATELY AFTER initialising app!!
